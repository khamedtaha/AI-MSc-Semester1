## Overview
This repository serves as a portfolio of my work in the first semester, covering foundational topics and practical applications in AI. The main focuses are :
- **Digital Image Processing** : Techniques for analyzing and transforming images.
- **Data Exploration and Visualization** : Data analysis and visualization to uncover patterns and insights.
- **Python Programming** : Implementing AI and data processing solutions in Python.

## Technologies
- **Programming Language** : Python
- **Libraries**:
  - **Image Processing** : OpenCV, Pillow
  - **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy , scikit-learn
  - **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Git, GitHub 

## Projects
A summary of the key projects included :

1. ### Digital Image Processing
   - **Project** : *Image Filters & Edge Detection*
   - **Description** : Implemented filters for image enhancement, including edge detection and transformation techniques.

2. ### Data Exploration and Visualization
   - **Project** : *Analysis on Wikipedia (Toys and Games)*
   - **Description** : The aim of this project is to explore and analyze an in-depth dataset (texts and images) to identify patterns, relationships and trends. The goal is to conduct data  cleaning and visualization and statistical analysis to obtain insights that will help in decision-making and build a search engine .

3. ### Python Programming
   - **Project** : *Stock and Sales Analysis*
   - **Description** : Developed a project to analyze stock and sales data, focusing on extracting insights, identifying trends, and automating reporting processes using Python.
   
   - **Project** : *Automatic Detection Algorithm for Counterfeit Banknotes*
   - **Description** : When a banknote arrives, we have a machine that records all its   geometric characteristics. 
    Over our years of effort, we have observed differences in dimensions between genuine and counterfeit banknotes. 
    These differences are difficult to detect with the naked eye, but a machine should have no problem distinguishing them.
    Thus, an algorithm should be built that, based on the geometric characteristics of a banknote, 
    would be capable of determining whether it is genuine or counterfeit.
